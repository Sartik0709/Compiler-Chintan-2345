Provide instructions and examples on how to use your project.

```bash
Buyers or tenants can look for properties in accordance with their budget, area preferences, and other requirements like the number of rooms and restrooms. This means that tenants won't have to deal with any middlemen to find the right rental property. All you need to do is visit the official website of
NoBroker
and proceed to get the services that you need.   The absence of brokers and middlemen is one of the biggest advantages of using the NoBroker app. Tenants can save a lot of money on brokerage fees because of this. The app offers its services for a small fee, which is significantly less than what brokers typically charge.
NoBroker app uses
Property owners can list their properties on the application and give precise data about the property, including photographs, area, and conveniences. This implies that occupants can come to an educated conclusion about the property they need to lease. The app also offers a number of additional services too that make renting easier for tenants. The app, for instance, lets tenants pay their rent without having to physically do so. They can also use the app to request home maintenance services like cleaning and repairs, which makes managing a rental property much simpler. Apart from this, they offer packers and movers services, interior design services, renovation services, home loan services, utility bills payment services, furniture and appliance renting services, painting services, pest control services, legal services, and many more.  NoBroker is currently available in Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, and other cities in India. It is a popular choice for tenants and property owners due to its user-friendly interface, transparent pricing, and additional services like rent payment and home maintenance. It is a great app for rental house searching without the involvement of brokers.
